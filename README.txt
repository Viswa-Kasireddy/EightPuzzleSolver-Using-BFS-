 * EightPuzzle is played on a 3-by-3 grid with 8 square blocks labeled 1 through 8 and a blank square represented\
 * as zero in this game. The goal is to rearrange the blocks so that they are in order. \
 * it is permitted to slide blocks horizontally or vertically into the blank square which is represented as zero\
 * \
 * Problem: Find a path from a start state to a goal state using Breadth First Search (BFS)\
 * \
 * Ex:\
 *  Start State (Initial Board): \
			 1 2 3\
 *                               4 5 6\
 *                               0 7 8\
 *                               \
 *  End State (Goal State):      \
			 1 2 3\
 *                               4 5 6\
 *                               7 8 0\
 *                               \
 * Solution:\
 * 1 2 3         1 2 3         1 2 3\
 * 4 5 6  ==> 4 5 6  ==> 4 5 6\
 * 0 7 8         7 0 8          7 8 0   \
